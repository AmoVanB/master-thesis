<p>This interface is part of my master thesis "<em>Using Service Discovery to Apply Policies in Networks</em>" submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of MSc in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Li√®ge (2014-2015).</p>

<p>The <code>service-discovery-daemon</code> software allows to announce on the public DNS services that have been initially announced on the local network via the Bonjour protocol. The application may be configured thanks to the current interface or the <code>/etc/service-discovery/config.xml</code> configuration file. The thesis report is available <a href="http://amaury.vanbemten.com/master-thesis/thesis.pdf">here</a> and the GitHub repository of the code <a href="https://github.com/amovanb/master-thesis">here</a>. The entire work's archive is, for its part, available <a href="http://amaury.vanbemten.com/master-thesis/thesis.zip">here</a>.</p>
