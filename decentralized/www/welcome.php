<p>This interface is part of my master thesis "Using Service Discovery to Apply Policies in Networks" submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Li√®ge (2014-2015).</p>

<p>The <code>service-discovery-daemon</code> software allows to announce services that have been announced on the local network via the Bonjour protocol on the public DNS. The software may be configured thanks to the current interface or the <code>/etc/service-discovery/config.xml</code> configuration file. The document containing the exact description of the tool and how to configure it is available <a href="">here</a>. The entire work's archive is, for its part, available <a href="">here</a>.</p>
